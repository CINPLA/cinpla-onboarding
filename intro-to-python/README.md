This is a simplified version of Introduction to Python. See "License" below for information about the original version. 

The intention of this repository is to be used internally in CINPLA for training in Python.

# Python-Lectures

## Introduction

Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming. 

Python, similar to other languages like matlab or R, is interpreted hence runs slowly compared to C++, Fortran or Java. However writing programs in Python is very quick. Python has a very large collection of libraries for everything from scientific computing to web services. It caters for object oriented and functional programming with module system that allows large and complex applications to be developed in Python. 

These lectures are using jupyter notebooks which mix Python code with documentation. The python notebooks can be run on a webserver or stand-alone on a computer.

## Contents

This course is broken up into a number of notebooks (chapters).

* [01](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CINPLA/python-lectures/blob/master/intro-to-python/01.ipynb) Basic data types and operations (numbers, strings) 
* [02](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CINPLA/python-lectures/blob/master/intro-to-python/02.ipynb) String manipulation 
* [03](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CINPLA/python-lectures/blob/master/intro-to-python/03.ipynb) Data structures: Lists and Tuples
* [04](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CINPLA/python-lectures/blob/master/intro-to-python/04.ipynb) Data structures (continued): dictionaries
* [05](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CINPLA/python-lectures/blob/master/intro-to-python/05.ipynb) Control statements: if, for, while, try statements
* [06](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CINPLA/python-lectures/blob/master/intro-to-python/06.ipynb) Functions
* [07](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CINPLA/python-lectures/blob/master/intro-to-python/07.ipynb) Arrays and plotting

This is a tutorial style introduction to Python. For a quick reminder / summary of Python syntax the following [Quick Reference Card](http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/csobaniec/software/python/py-qrc.html) may be useful. A longer and more detailed tutorial style introduction to python is available from the python site at: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/


## Installation

Python runs on windows, linux, mac and other environments. There are many python distributions available. However the recommended way to install python under Microsoft Windows or Linux is to use the Anaconda distribution available at [https://www.continuum.io/downloads]. Make sure to get the Python *3.5* version, not 2.7. This distribution comes with the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) collection of scientific python tools as well as the iron python notebook. 

To open a notebook with anaconda installed, from the terminal run:

    jupyter notebook
